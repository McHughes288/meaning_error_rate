None error - almost perfect recognized transcript (e.g. differing comma/space/hyphen placement, repeated words and disfluencies are fine).

Minor error - easily able to read through (e.g. incorrect capitalisation, pronouns/prepositions, omission of secondary detail).

Standard error - disrupts the flow and comprehension (e.g. misrecognized/omitted names, homophones/sound-alikes, omission of primary detail).

Serious error - misinformation which changes meaning (e.g. alternative names/numbers, incorrect word endings/contractions, omission causing misinformation).
